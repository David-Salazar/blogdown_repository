<p>Over the next few days, I’ll go over (this time I am paying and thus have access to the exams :)) the deeplearning.ai Coursera Specialization. Here, I’ll gather my notes of the course for easy access:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="/2019/12/18/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a></li>
<li>Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.</li>
<li>Structuring Machine Learning Projects.</li>
<li>Convolutional Neural Networks.</li>
<li>Sequence Models.</li>
</ol>
<div id="why" class="section level2">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I have already used DL in a couple of personal projects. However, I am still not 100% comfortable with neural networks. I hope to build my confidence by taking these series of courses.</p>
