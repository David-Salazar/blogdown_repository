# Week 1 

## Why Neural Networks?

A single neuron can be thought as any function: it takes an input and outputs the input transformed. The magic of neural networks resides on stacking many of these together. 

> So if this is a single neuron, neural network, really a tiny little neural network, a larger neural network is then formed by taking many of the single neurons and stacking them together. So, if you think of this neuron that's being like a single Lego brick, you then get a bigger neural network by stacking together many of these Lego bricks.

By stacking them up, we can create hidden neural networks. These will eventually compute the optimal input transformation to finally output the last value.

> How you manage neural network is that when you implement it, you need to give it just the input x and the output y for a number of examples in your training set and all this things in the middle, they will figure out by itself.

> So for example, rather than saying these first nodes represent family size and family size depends only on the features X1 and X2. Instead, we're going to say, well neural network, you decide whatever you want this known to be. And we'll give you all four of the features to complete whatever you want.

## Economic value from Neural Networks

Most of the economic value has come from supervised learning using neural networks. That is:

> So a lot of the value creation through neural networks has been through cleverly selecting what should be x and what should be y

And then letting the network figure out the latent structure of the data to predict $y$.

### Structured vs Unstructured

> Structured Data means basically databases of data.

> In contrast, unstructured data refers to things like audio, raw audio, or images where you might want to recognize what's in the image or text. Here the features might be the pixel values in an image or the individual words in a piece of text.

Up until a few years ago, unstructured data was not accessible to computers:

> And so one of the most exciting things about the rise of neural networks is that, thanks to deep learning, thanks to neural networks, computers are now much better at interpreting unstructured data as well compared to just a few years ago. And this creates opportunities for many new exciting applications that use speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing on text...

If they are so useful, but we have known about them for so long, why only now have they started to flourish?

## Why now? Scale, scale and scale

Let's imagine two different regimes. In one regime, equality is king and ingenuity rules: when we have few labeled data. Then, hand-engineered features can make any machine learning algorithm the best at hand.

> In this regime of smaller training sets the relative ordering of the algorithms is actually not very well defined so if you don't have a lot of training data is often up to your skill at hand engineering features that determines the foreman so it's quite possible that if someone training an SVM is more motivated to hand engineer features and someone training even large their own that may be in this small training set regime the SVM could do better so you know in this region to the left of the figure the relative ordering between gene algorithms is not that well defined and performance depends much more on your skill at engine features and other mobile details of the algorithms. 

Whereas in the second regime, when we have lots and lots of labeled data, large neural networks dominate every other machine learning algorithm out there. 

### Universal Approximators

The real reason why neural network seem to dominate every other machine learning algorithm out there when we are in the scale regime, is their capacity: they can fit almost any function out there. That is, they are universal approximators. Thus, if we have enough data, no matter how crazy the function must look like to approximate our data, the neural networks can find a way to get us towards that crazy function. I found a [visual proof](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) of the theorem very illuminating. 

With the Digital Society that we have now and the new computation resources we can have access to, we have entered the second regime:

> Well you know was it they didn't know what to do with huge amounts of data and what happened in our society over the last 10 years maybe is that for a lot of problems we went from having a relatively small amount of data to having you know often a fairly large amount of data and all of this was thanks to the digitization of a society

>  we also just have been collecting one more and more data so over the last 20 years for a lot of applications we just accumulate a lot more data more than traditional learning algorithms were able to effectively take advantage of

Thus, the answer to the former question: Neural networks have taken a leading role in the stage as soon as we entered into the regime of scale, both in computing power and in the size of labeled data availabe to us. 

# Week 2

Objectives: 

- **Learn vectorization in Python: avoiding explicit for-loops**

- **Learn what a forward and backward pass mean in the context of logistic regression implemented as a one neural network.**

## Notation

![Notation](/images/notation.PNG)

Notice the importance of the following variables:

$m$, the number of training examples. $n_X$, the number of input variables. Also, notice that in this course we will stack as columns each observation, both in $X$ and $Y$.

## Logistic Regression

We want a function of parameters $w, b$ such that it is going to output something we can call $P(Y = 1| x)$. $ Xw + b$, which we would use in linear regression, seems wrong. Enter the sigmoid function defined thus:

$$ \sigma (z) = \frac{1}{1 + e ^{-z}}  $$

Notice that:

- as $z \to \infty$, $\sigma (z) \approx 1$ .

- as $z \to -\infty$, $\sigma (z) \approx 0$ .

## A rational loss function

We must tell our algorithm when it commits mistakes and when it is not. To do so, we create a loss function. For logistic regression, we are going to use the following: 


![](/images/cost_logistic.PNG)

Note that, *the cost function is different to the loss function*.

Although Andrew gave a great intuitive explanation, mainly that the loss function will tell the algorithm (in order to minimize the loss function) to make $\hat{y}$ large when $y=1$ and small when $y=0$, I think it is worth the trouble to go over the derivation of this cost function from a maximum likelihood perspective. 

### Arriving at cost function: Maximum Likelihood

Positing that the data comes from a bernoulli:

Thus, the PMF is as follows:

$$ p(y) =  (p)^y (1 - p)^{(1 - y)} $$

If the data comes from an $i.i.d$, the joint probability is simply a multiplication of the respective PMFs of the $x^{i}$. The log of that expression, then, will be the following sum:

$$ \sum_M log((p)^y (1 - p)^{(1 - y))} $$
Applying simple logarithm rules:

$$ \sum_M y log(p) + (1 - y) log (1 - p)  $$

Then, as we switch the function to treat $y, x$ as given, and $w, b$ as parameters, we arrive at:

$$ \sum_M y log(p(w, b; x)) + (1 - y) log (1 - p(w, b; x)) $$

Then, in the maximum likelihood paradigm, we would maximize this quantity. However, we can just put a negative sign in front of it and minimize it. We would then, model $p$ with a logistic function depending on the parameters $w, b$. And voila! we arrive at the aforementioned cost function.  

## Gradient Descent 

Let's take the cost function? What do we do now?

> And what we want to do is really to find the value of w and b that corresponds to the minimum of the cost function $J$.

How do we find these special values $(w^*, b^*)$? 

> So to find a good value for the parameters, what we'll do is initialize $w$ and $b$ to some initial value, maybe denoted by that little red dot. And for logistic regression almost any initialization method works, usually you initialize the value to zero. Random initialization also works, but people don't usually do that for logistic regression. But because this function is convex, no matter where you initialize, you should get to the same point or roughly the same point. And what gradient descent does is it starts at that initial point and then **takes a step in the steepest downhill direction**. So after one step of gradient descent you might end up there, because it's trying to take a step downhill in the direction of steepest descent or as quickly downhill as possible. 

Andrew shows that, after initializing at a random value, taking a step into the direction of the gradient is equivalent to taking a step in the "steepest downhill direction". Why is that? 

### Minimizing directional derivative

Let's take an analysis into what happens when we move the function in the direction $\vec{v}$ just a little bit ($\vec{v}$ being an unit vector, or just a direction within a unit ball around the starting point):

$$ D_{\hat{\vec{v}}} h = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{h(\vec{x} + t \vec{v} ) - h(\vec{x})}{t} $$
That is called, the directional derivative. And for a function in two variables, like our cost function, is the following:

$$ D_{\hat{\vec{v}}} C(w, b; x_0) = C(w, b; x_0)_{w} v_w + C(w, b; x_0)_{b} v_b = \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v} $$

Thus, if we want to maximize this growth, we must choose $\vec{v}$ such that it maximizes: $ \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v}$. We must remember the equivalent formulation of the dot product:

$$  \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v} = || \nabla C(w, b; x_0) || \cdot || \vec{v} || \cos \theta $$
However, $\vec{v}$ is a unit vector. Thus: 

$$ \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v} =  || \nabla C(w, b; x_0) || \cos \theta$$
Thus, we must choose $\theta$ such that the expression is maximized. Cosine has a maximum of $1$ at $\theta = 0$, which thus says that the two vectors, the gradient and the direction, must be aligned. That is, **the direction must be equal to the gradient evaluated at the initial point**. 

Equivalently, to minimize the expresion, we must have cosine equal to $-1$, which happens at $\theta = \pi$. Which thus says that **the direction we must take is parallel to the negative (opposite) of the gradient vector evaluated at the initial point**. 

## Computational Graphs and backprop

A computational graph is a way to order and compute the required mathematical steps to arrive at a certain value. Specially, to compute multiple function compositions into sequential steps- For a given neural network implementation, and for one training example, we can conceive of it as a computational graph. Setting up in this way, allows us to optimize the final value more easily than if we were to analytically derive the gradient of the final value through the original function compositions. 

> So, the computation graph comes in handy when there is some distinguished or some special output variable, such as J in this case, that you want to optimize

In order words, a neural network can be conceived, as an abstract:

$$ f(g(h(i(....)))$$
Whereas the derivatives may get unwieldy by looking at the neural network this way, we may instead switch our perspective to that of a computational graph. There, the chain rule looks much easier to calculate for any given initialization. 

Notice that if we may use backprop in this way, we must be able to combine the derivatives of the loss functions of each training example into the derivative of the overall cost function. 

### Example with logistic regression

So, thanks to conceiving our neural network, for some value of the parameters, and for one training example, as a computational graph, we can use backpropagation to find out the gradient of our loss function with respect to the parameters. We, then, can compute the gradient of the cost function by combining these individual gradients and, finally, move into these direction to take a gradient step. Which can be seen in Andrew's pseudocode:

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/one_step_gradient.PNG)

However, notice that in the pseudocode there are three for loops, two implicit and one explicit. 

1. The code only performs one step of gradient descent. We must loop over many steps.
1. For each step, we must loop over each training observation to calculate the cost gradient and take a step in that direction. 
1. For each training observation, we must loop over the parameters to start acumulating the value of their respective partial derivatives.

Let's see if the wonders of vectorisation can help us.

## Vectorisation

> Vectorization is basically the art of getting rid of explicit folders in your code. In the deep learning era safety in deep learning in practice,

> Whenever possible avoid explicit for-loops.

Before, we defined 3 possible for-loops that were present in our training. With vectorisation, we can get rid of two of them.

- **For each step, we must loop over each training observation to calculate the cost gradient and take a step in that direction.**
- **For each training observation, we must loop over the parameters to start acumulating the value of their respective partial derivatives.**

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/vectorisation_1.PNG)

Notice how we can do a forward pass for all of the observations by stacking the individual observations vectors into columns of a matrix.

We can also perform the backprop algorithm, all at once:

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/vectorisation_2.PNG)

In code:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/home/davidsalazarv95/anaconda3/lib")
```


```{python eval=FALSE}
import numpy as np

Z = np.dot(w.T, X) + b

A = sigmoid(Z)

dZ = A - Y

dw = 1/m * np.dot(X, dZ.T)

db = 1/m * np.sum(dZ)

```

## Broadcasting

> If you take a 4 by 1 vector and add it to a number, what Python will do is take this number and auto-expand it into a four by one vector as well, as follows.

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) + 5
```

> If you have an (m,n) matrix and you add or subtract or multiply or divide with a (1,n) matrix, then this will copy it n times into an (m,n) matrix.

```{python}
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],[9, 10, 11, 12]])
col_avg = np.mean(matrix, axis = 0)
print(matrix)
print(col_avg)
matrix/col_avg
```

> If conversely, you were to take the (m,n) matrix and add, subtract, multiply, divide by an (m,1) matrix, then also this would copy it now n times. And turn that into an (m,n) matrix and then apply the operation element wise

```{python}
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],[9, 10, 11, 12]])
row_avg = np.mean(matrix, axis = 1)
row_avg = row_avg.reshape(3, 1)
print(matrix)
print(row_avg)
matrix/row_avg
```


## Assingments' need to remember:

**What you need to remember:**

Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
- Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
- Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
- "Standardize" the data

You've implemented several functions that:
- Initialize (w,b)
- Optimize the loss iteratively to learn parameters (w,b):
    - computing the cost and its gradient 
    - updating the parameters using gradient descent
- Use the learned (w,b) to predict the labels for a given set of examples

1. Preprocessing the dataset is important.
2. You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!

# Week 3

We already know how to fit a logistic regression. Can we expand it to fit a neural network? The answer is a resounding yes!

> As I'd already previously alluded, you can form a neural network by stacking together a lot of little sigmoid units.

> the key intuition to take away is that whereas for logistic regression, we had this z followed by a calculation. In this neural network, here we just do it multiple times, as a z followed by a calculation, and a z followed by a calculation, and then you finally compute the loss at the end.

> So, that gives you a quick overview of what a neural network looks like. It's basically taken logistic regression and repeating it twice.

## Hidden Layer

So, in what sense is a neural network repeating logistic regression multiple times? In the sense that we compute a hidden layer: a layer which takes inputs and outputs a different representation of these inputs. Then, this different representation is used in the final logistic regression that will output the final value. 

Why do we call these different representation a hidden layer? Because we can never compare these computed values with anything in the training set. They are hidden in the structure of the data and it is the responsability of the neural network to find it; it is its biggest advantage to be able to do so in a data-intensive way. 

## Notation

The fact that we have multiple layers, creates the necessity of multiple matrices and multiple parameter vectors. The output of the first logistic regression, then, becomes the input that will be multiplied by the second parameter vector ....

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/multiple_layer.PNG)

Then, to create a neural network, will create multiple logistic regressions to grow the size of the hidden layer and thus the size of the different representation of the data. This, in turn, will be handled by stacking up the multiple parameter vectors for each layer into one matrix. 

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/stacking.PNG)

The squared superscript will refer to the neural network's layer where we will use the matrix in question.

Finally, the vectorised version will be to stack up the activation vectors into one matrix. We can traverse the matrix row by row, which will give us the different results from the different hidden units, or by column, which will traverse the different training observations. 

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/vectorisation_nnm.PNG)

## Activation function

So far, we have been doing thus: a linear combination of inputs, and then applying a sigmoid function. However, we can use any function after the linear combination; we don't necessarily have to use the sigmoid. Other alternatives are:

- Hyperbolic tangent function:

> And it turns out for hidden units, if you let the function g of z be equal to tanh(z), this almost always works better than the sigmoid function because the values between plus 1 and minus 1, the mean of the activations that come out of your head, and they are closer to having a 0 mean.

Why?

> And so just as sometimes when you train a learning algorithm, you might center the data and have your data have 0 mean using a tanh instead of a sigmoid function. It kind of has the effect of centering your data so that the mean of your data is closer to 0 rather than, maybe 0.5. 

However, both the sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent suffer from the same problem: for large other small values, the derivatives go to zero. Then, large or small values will slow down learning.

> Now, one of the downsides of both the sigmoid function and the tanh function is that if z is either very large or very small, then the gradient or the derivative or the slope of this function becomes very small. 

We can solve this problem by using A $ReLu(z) = max(0, z)$:

>  And the main reason is that there is less of these effects of the slope of the function going to 0, which slows down learning. And I know that for half of the range of z, the slope of ReLU is 0, but in practice, enough of your hidden units will have z greater than 0.

## Why bother with any activation function at all?

Let's suppose we get rid of our activation function. Then, we will be doing linear combinations of linear combinations, which is itself a linear combination. Then, the hidden layers will be useless: that is, this neural network will be equivalent to a single layer neural network that we explored (logistic regression).

> And we'll talk about deep networks later, neural networks with many, many layers, many hidden layers. And it turns out that if you use a linear activation function or alternatively, if you don't have an activation function, then no matter how many layers your neural network has, all it's doing is just computing a linear activation function.

Interestingly, the Universal Approximator characteristic of neural networks only holds for activation function. That is, the non-linearity that these functions introduce is what allows neural networks to create internal representations of the data to best approach any learning problem. 

## Backprop

As before, we create a computational graph for a given initialization of our network, and then compute the gradient by going backwards. We can do so as follows:

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/backprop_nn.PNG)

Notice that the only new thing is the chain rule, which is simply an elementary-wise matrix multiplication

## Random Initialization

So far, we have talked about initializiang the parameters in our neural network. But how to do it? A reasonable proposable may be to start all the values to zero? Is this a good idea?

Let's create a computational graph with these values. All the hidden units will have the same linear combination. And thus the same value, as will go over the same activation function. Thus, once we run the backward pass to do backprop, all the parameters will have the same gradient and will be updated in exactly the same way. 

Thus, a neural network with more than one hidden unit, initialized this way, would be redundant. 

> Sometimes you say they're completely symmetric, which just means that they're completing exactly the same function. And by kind of a proof by induction, it turns out that after every single iteration of training your two hidden units are still computing exactly the same function.

> So it's possible to construct a proof by induction that if you initialize all the ways, all the values of w to 0, then because both hidden units start off computing the same function. And both hidden the units have the same influence on the output unit, then after one iteration, that same statement is still true, the two hidden units are still symmetric. And therefore, by induction, after two iterations, three iterations and so on, no matter how long you train your neural network, both hidden units are still computing exactly the same function. And so in this case, there's really no point to having more than one hidden unit. 

Thus, random initialization of the parameters seem much more appealing. However, we must be careful that the parameters won't be too large. If they are, our linear combination result will be too big, and when computing gradient, will slow down. This holds when we have ANY activation function in the network that is a sigmoid or a hyperbolic tangent. 

## Conclusions

**Reminder**: The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:
    1. Define the neural network structure ( # of input units,  # of hidden units, etc). 
    2. Initialize the model's parameters
    3. Loop:
        - Implement forward propagation
        - Compute loss
        - Implement backward propagation to get the gradients
        - Update parameters (gradient descent)

You often build helper functions to compute steps 1-3 and then merge them into one function we call `nn_model()`. Once you've built `nn_model()` and learnt the right parameters, you can make predictions on new data.

# Week 4

## L-layer Neural Network

> We say that logistic regression is a very "shallow" model, whereas this model here is a much deeper model, and shallow versus depth is a matter of degree

>  but over the last several years the AI, on the machine learning community, has realized that there are functions that very deep neural networks can learn that shallower models are often unable to.

Why can deep neural network capture structure in the data that shallower nets cannot?

### Deep Neural Networks

A Neural Network performs multiple transformation to the original inputs; data-driven transformations that allows us to represent the data to the best of our ability to then predict our quantity of interest. Then, the 1st layer transform the inputs; the 2nd layer transforms the former transformation; the 3rd, again, transform the former transformation; and so on... This type of multiple transformation allows us to start from simple features and then progressively join them together to capture more complex and important features. That is, deep neural networks allow us to capture the hierarchical structure in the data. 

### Notation

> If the pieces we've seen so far looks a little bit familiar to you, that's because what we're seeing is taking a piece very similar to what you've seen in the neural network with a single hidden layer and just repeating that more times. Now, it turns out that we implement a deep neural network
