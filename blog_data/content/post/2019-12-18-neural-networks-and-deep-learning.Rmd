# Week 1 

## Why Neural Networks?

A single neuron can be thought as any function: it takes an input and outputs the input transformed. The magic of neural networks resides on stacking many of these together. 

> So if this is a single neuron, neural network, really a tiny little neural network, a larger neural network is then formed by taking many of the single neurons and stacking them together. So, if you think of this neuron that's being like a single Lego brick, you then get a bigger neural network by stacking together many of these Lego bricks.

By stacking them up, we can create hidden neural networks. These will eventually compute the optimal input transformation to finally output the last value.

> How you manage neural network is that when you implement it, you need to give it just the input x and the output y for a number of examples in your training set and all this things in the middle, they will figure out by itself.

> So for example, rather than saying these first nodes represent family size and family size depends only on the features X1 and X2. Instead, we're going to say, well neural network, you decide whatever you want this known to be. And we'll give you all four of the features to complete whatever you want.

## Economic value from Neural Networks

Most of the economic value has come from supervised learning using neural networks. That is:

> So a lot of the value creation through neural networks has been through cleverly selecting what should be x and what should be y

And then letting the network figure out the latent structure of the data to predict $y$.

### Structured vs Unstructured

> Structured Data means basically databases of data.

> In contrast, unstructured data refers to things like audio, raw audio, or images where you might want to recognize what's in the image or text. Here the features might be the pixel values in an image or the individual words in a piece of text.

Up until a few years ago, unstructured data was not accessible to computers:

> And so one of the most exciting things about the rise of neural networks is that, thanks to deep learning, thanks to neural networks, computers are now much better at interpreting unstructured data as well compared to just a few years ago. And this creates opportunities for many new exciting applications that use speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing on text...

If they are so useful, but we have known about them for so long, why only now have they started to flourish?

## Why now? Scale, scale and scale

Let's imagine two different regimes. In one regime, equality is king and ingenuity rules: when we have few labeled data. Then, hand-engineered features can make any machine learning algorithm the best at hand.

> In this regime of smaller training sets the relative ordering of the algorithms is actually not very well defined so if you don't have a lot of training data is often up to your skill at hand engineering features that determines the foreman so it's quite possible that if someone training an SVM is more motivated to hand engineer features and someone training even large their own that may be in this small training set regime the SVM could do better so you know in this region to the left of the figure the relative ordering between gene algorithms is not that well defined and performance depends much more on your skill at engine features and other mobile details of the algorithms. 

Whereas in the second regime, when we have lots and lots of labeled data, large neural networks dominate every other machine learning algorithm out there. 

### Universal Approximators

The real reason why neural network seem to dominate every other machine learning algorithm out there when we are in the scale regime, is their capacity: they can fit almost any function out there. That is, they are universal approximators. Thus, if we have enough data, no matter how crazy the function must look like to approximate our data, the neural networks can find a way to get us towards that crazy function. I found a [visual proof](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) of the theorem very illuminating. 

With the Digital Society that we have now and the new computation resources we can have access to, we have entered the second regime:

> Well you know was it they didn't know what to do with huge amounts of data and what happened in our society over the last 10 years maybe is that for a lot of problems we went from having a relatively small amount of data to having you know often a fairly large amount of data and all of this was thanks to the digitization of a society

>  we also just have been collecting one more and more data so over the last 20 years for a lot of applications we just accumulate a lot more data more than traditional learning algorithms were able to effectively take advantage of

Thus, the answer to the former question: Neural networks have taken a leading role in the stage as soon as we entered into the regime of scale, both in computing power and in the size of labeled data availabe to us. 

# Week 2

Objectives: 

- **Learn vectorization in Python: avoiding explicit for-loops**

- **Learn what a forward and backward pass mean in the context of logistic regression implemented as a one neural network.**

## Notation

![Notation](/images/notation.PNG)

Notice the importance of the following variables:

$m$, the number of training examples. $n_X$, the number of input variables. Also, notice that in this course we will stack as columns each observation, both in $X$ and $Y$.

## Logistic Regression

We want a function of parameters $w, b$ such that it is going to output something we can call $P(Y = 1| x)$. $ Xw + b$, which we would use in linear regression, seems wrong. Enter the sigmoid function defined thus:

$$ \sigma (z) = \frac{1}{1 + e ^{-z}}  $$

Notice that:

- as $z \to \infty$, $\sigma (z) \approx 1$ .

- as $z \to -\infty$, $\sigma (z) \approx 0$ .

## A rational loss function

We must tell our algorithm when it commits mistakes and when it is not. To do so, we create a loss function. For logistic regression, we are going to use the following: 


![](/images/cost_logistic.PNG)

Note that, *the cost function is different to the loss function*.

Although Andrew gave a great intuitive explanation, mainly that the loss function will tell the algorithm (in order to minimize the loss function) to make $\hat{y}$ large when $y=1$ and small when $y=0$, I think it is worth the trouble to go over the derivation of this cost function from a maximum likelihood perspective. 

### Arriving at cost function: Maximum Likelihood

Positing that the data comes from a bernoulli:

Thus, the PMF is as follows:

$$ p(y) =  (p)^y (1 - p)^{(1 - y)} $$

If the data comes from an $i.i.d$, the joint probability is simply a multiplication of the respective PMFs of the $x^{i}$. The log of that expression, then, will be the following sum:

$$ \sum_M log((p)^y (1 - p)^{(1 - y))} $$
Applying simple logarithm rules:

$$ \sum_M y log(p) + (1 - y) log (1 - p)  $$

Then, as we switch the function to treat $y, x$ as given, and $w, b$ as parameters, we arrive at:

$$ \sum_M y log(p(w, b; x)) + (1 - y) log (1 - p(w, b; x)) $$

Then, in the maximum likelihood paradigm, we would maximize this quantity. However, we can just put a negative sign in front of it and minimize it. We would then, model $p$ with a logistic function depending on the parameters $w, b$. And voila! we arrive at the aforementioned cost function.  

## Gradient Descent 

Let's take the cost function? What do we do now?

> And what we want to do is really to find the value of w and b that corresponds to the minimum of the cost function $J$.

How do we find these special values $(w^*, b^*)$? 

> So to find a good value for the parameters, what we'll do is initialize $w$ and $b$ to some initial value, maybe denoted by that little red dot. And for logistic regression almost any initialization method works, usually you initialize the value to zero. Random initialization also works, but people don't usually do that for logistic regression. But because this function is convex, no matter where you initialize, you should get to the same point or roughly the same point. And what gradient descent does is it starts at that initial point and then **takes a step in the steepest downhill direction**. So after one step of gradient descent you might end up there, because it's trying to take a step downhill in the direction of steepest descent or as quickly downhill as possible. 

Andrew shows that, after initializing at a random value, taking a step into the direction of the gradient is equivalent to taking a step in the "steepest downhill direction". Why is that? 

### Minimizing directional derivative

Let's take an analysis into what happens when we move the function in the direction $\vec{v}$ just a little bit ($\vec{v}$ being an unit vector, or just a direction within a unit ball around the starting point):

$$ D_{\hat{\vec{v}}} h = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{h(\vec{x} + t \vec{v} ) - h(\vec{x})}{t} $$
That is called, the directional derivative. And for a function in two variables, like our cost function, is the following:

$$ D_{\hat{\vec{v}}} C(w, b; x_0) = C(w, b; x_0)_{w} v_w + C(w, b; x_0)_{b} v_b = \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v} $$

Thus, if we want to maximize this growth, we must choose $\vec{v}$ such that it maximizes: $ \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v}$. We must remember the equivalent formulation of the dot product:

$$  \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v} = || \nabla C(w, b; x_0) || \cdot || \vec{v} || \cos \theta $$
However, $\vec{v}$ is a unit vector. Thus: 

$$ \nabla C(w, b; x_0) \vec{v} =  || \nabla C(w, b; x_0) || \cos \theta$$
Thus, we must choose $\theta$ such that the expression is maximized. Cosine has a maximum of $1$ at $\theta = 0$, which thus says that the two vectors, the gradient and the direction, must be aligned. That is, **the direction must be equal to the gradient evaluated at the initial point**. 

Equivalently, to minimize the expresion, we must have cosine equal to $-1$, which happens at $\theta = \pi$. Which thus says that **the direction we must take is parallel to the negative (opposite) of the gradient vector evaluated at the initial point**. 

## Computational Graphs and backprop

A computational graph is a way to order and compute the required mathematical steps to arrive at a certain value. Specially, to compute multiple function compositions into sequential steps- For a given neural network implementation, and for one training example, we can conceive of it as a computational graph. Setting up in this way, allows us to optimize the final value more easily than if we were to analytically derive the gradient of the final value through the original function compositions. 

> So, the computation graph comes in handy when there is some distinguished or some special output variable, such as J in this case, that you want to optimize

In order words, a neural network can be conceived, as an abstract:

$$ f(g(h(i(....)))$$
Whereas the derivatives may get unwieldy by looking at the neural network this way, we may instead switch our perspective to that of a computational graph. There, the chain rule looks much easier to calculate for any given initialization. 

Notice that if we may use backprop in this way, we must be able to combine the derivatives of the loss functions of each training example into the derivative of the overall cost function. 

### Example with logistic regression

So, thanks to conceiving our neural network, for some value of the parameters, and for one training example, as a computational graph, we can use backpropagation to find out the gradient of our loss function with respect to the parameters. We, then, can compute the gradient of the cost function by combining these individual gradients and, finally, move into these direction to take a gradient step. Which can be seen in Andrew's pseudocode:

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/one_step_gradient.PNG)

However, notice that in the pseudocode there are three for loops, two implicit and one explicit. 

1. The code only performs one step of gradient descent. We must loop over many steps.
1. For each step, we must loop over each training observation to calculate the cost gradient and take a step in that direction. 
1. For each training observation, we must loop over the parameters to start acumulating the value of their respective partial derivatives.

Let's see if the wonders of vectorisation can help us.

## Vectorisation

> Vectorization is basically the art of getting rid of explicit folders in your code. In the deep learning era safety in deep learning in practice,

> Whenever possible avoid explicit for-loops.

Before, we defined 3 possible for-loops that were present in our training. With vectorisation, we can get rid of two of them.

- **For each step, we must loop over each training observation to calculate the cost gradient and take a step in that direction.**
- **For each training observation, we must loop over the parameters to start acumulating the value of their respective partial derivatives.**

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/vectorisation_1.PNG)

Notice how we can do a forward pass for all of the observations by stacking the individual observations vectors into columns of a matrix.

We can also perform the backprop algorithm, all at once:

![](/images/1_deeplearning.ai/vectorisation_2.PNG)

In code:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/home/davidsalazarv95/anaconda3/lib")
```


```{python eval=FALSE}
import numpy as np

Z = np.dot(w.T, X) + b

A = sigmoid(Z)

dZ = A - Y

dw = 1/m * np.dot(X, dZ.T)

db = 1/m * np.sum(dZ)

```

## Broadcasting

> If you take a 4 by 1 vector and add it to a number, what Python will do is take this number and auto-expand it into a four by one vector as well, as follows.

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) + 5
```

> If you have an (m,n) matrix and you add or subtract or multiply or divide with a (1,n) matrix, then this will copy it n times into an (m,n) matrix.

```{python}
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],[9, 10, 11, 12]])
col_avg = np.mean(matrix, axis = 0)
print(matrix)
print(col_avg)
matrix/col_avg
```

> If conversely, you were to take the (m,n) matrix and add, subtract, multiply, divide by an (m,1) matrix, then also this would copy it now n times. And turn that into an (m,n) matrix and then apply the operation element wise

```{python}
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],[9, 10, 11, 12]])
row_avg = np.mean(matrix, axis = 1)
row_avg = row_avg.reshape(3, 1)
print(matrix)
print(row_avg)
matrix/row_avg
```


## Assingments' need to remember:

**What you need to remember:**

Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
- Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
- Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
- "Standardize" the data

You've implemented several functions that:
- Initialize (w,b)
- Optimize the loss iteratively to learn parameters (w,b):
    - computing the cost and its gradient 
    - updating the parameters using gradient descent
- Use the learned (w,b) to predict the labels for a given set of examples

1. Preprocessing the dataset is important.
2. You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!
