# Referential Array

Arrays in pythons do not hold he objects themselves, but pointers to that objects. This can create problems with shallowcopying. For example: 

```{r include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/home/davidsalazarv95/anaconda3/lib")
```

Each index of each list contains a pointer to an object. 

```{python}
first_list = [1, 2, 3]
second_list = [4, 5, 6]
third_list = [7, 8, 9]
print(first_list)
```

What if we want to combine these lists?

```{python}
first_list.extend(second_list)
third_list.append(second_list)
print(first_list)
print(third_list)
```

Now, `first_list` points to the same object as second list. Thus, changing where the second list points too won't change the first list points to. However, `third_list` will point to `second_list`. Thus, changing `second_list` will change where `third_list` points to. 

```{python}
second_list[0] = 10
print(first_list)
print(third_list)
```

Notice how `list.append()` and `list.extend` differ.
