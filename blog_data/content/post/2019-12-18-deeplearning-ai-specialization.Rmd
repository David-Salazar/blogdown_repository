# deeplearning.ai

Over the next few days, I'll go over (this time I am paying and thus have access to the exams :)) the deeplearning.ai Coursera Specialization. Here, I'll gather my notes of the course for easy access: 

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](/2019/12/18/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/)
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization. 
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects. 
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.
5. Sequence Models. 

## Why?

I have already used DL in a couple of personal projects. However, I am still not 100% comfortable with neural networks. I hope to build my confidence by taking these series of courses.
